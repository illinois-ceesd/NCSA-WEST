# MIRGE Code-Along Instructions

To follow along with the demos:

- Click [this link](https://koelsch-hub.tiker.net/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fillinois-ceesd%2FNCSA-WEST&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FNCSA-WEST%2Fmirge&branch=main).
- Use your NetID, enter your chosen password at first login (please remember it!).
- Create a new notebook, enter the following line:
  ```
  !pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  and hit Shift-Enter. Wait for the process to finish, then close the notebook.
  You may delete it if you like. Observe the new `src` folder that showed up
  on the left. (If you're curious: running the same command from the terminal
  will *not* work.)
- Now switch to the `cleared-demos` folder on the left to follow along
  (or peek into `demos` for the fully worked examples). You're good to go.
