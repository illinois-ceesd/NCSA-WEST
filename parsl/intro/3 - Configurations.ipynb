    "## Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent the available compute resources at a machine level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ThreadPoolExecutor** - Use for single machine setups\n",
    "* **HighThroughputExector** - Use for HPC environments where you need less than 2000 nodes needed for the job.\n",
    "* **ExtremeScaleExecutor** - Use for HPC environments where you need between 1000 and 8000 nodes\n",

    "## Launchers\n",
    "\n",
    "These create wrappers for your submitted code, e.g. in a Slurm environment the Launcher wraps the submitted code in an SRUN framework. \n",

    "## Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "These represent the route of communication from where you are submitting the job to the compute resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LocalChannel** - Use this any time you are launching your Parsl job from a submit node or are using the ThreadPoolExecutor.\n",
    "* **SSHChannel** - Allows for remote execution on machines where you have an SSH key set up.\n",
    "* **OAuthSSHChannel** - Allows for remote execution on machines where you have Globus OAuth tokens set up.\n",
    "* **SSHInteractiveLoginChannel** - Allows for remote execution using SSH where a key has not been set up.\n",

    " \n",
    "### Elasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Workload requirements often scale with time, sometimes many nodes running in parallel are needed, followed by a task that requires only a single node (e.g. combining results), which is then followed by a tasks that require several nodes again. Parsl addresses this be dynamically provisionning blocks in response to compute need.\n",
