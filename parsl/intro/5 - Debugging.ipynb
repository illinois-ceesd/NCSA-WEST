    "In the case something goes wrong on the Parsl side of things there are a few ways to try and debug the code. There are debug arguments to many of the classes (executors, etc.) which can output more information to the logs. You can also specify where these logs go in some instances. Here we will look at the default logging infrastructure. There are many different layouts for the logging infrastructure on disk, depending on the number of executors, type of channels, number of apps, etc. But they all follow the same general pattern. "
