# Parsl Tutorial

The notebooks here are the basic [Parsl](https://parsl-project.org) tutorial given at the workshop. Please be sure to [install](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) Parsl before running them (pip or conda should work fine.)  In addition, the presentation slides about Parsl are available via [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aBd9l3pePG7gtaXdaeRsubttvbuD-ksK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386689225117375572&rtpof=true&sd=true).
